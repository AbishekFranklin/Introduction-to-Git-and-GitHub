Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory of your Git repository using the cd command. For example:

bash

cd path/to/your/repository

Use a text editor to open the README.md file. You can use commands like nano, vim, or code depending on your preference and setup. For example:

nano README.md

Make the necessary changes to the footer in the README.md file. Find the footer section and replace "explain in steps" with your desired phrase.

Save the changes and exit the text editor.

Use the git status command to see the changes you've made. This will show you the modified file(s).

Add the modified file to the staging area using the git add command. For example:

csharp

git add README.md

Commit the changes with a meaningful message describing the fix. Use the git commit command followed by the -m flag and your message. For example:

sql

git commit -m "Update footer in README.md with new instruction"

Push the changes to your remote repository if necessary. If you're working on a branch and want to push it to the remote repository, you can use the git push command. For example:

perl

git push origin your_branch_name
